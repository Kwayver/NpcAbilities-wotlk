# NpcAbilities v1.1.0 for WoW v3.3.5a
Inspired by rubenzantingh and their Addon of the same name for retail and classic WoW
Developed for Ephemeral WoW private server

I am not a developer. This was mostly made with AI and assistance from people much smarter than me. Whilst being similar to the inspired addon, it lacks many of the advanced features they have such as keybinds for expanding spells and language localisation.

Special thanks to:
- rubenzantingh
- Ephemeral WoW
- My talented girlfriend
